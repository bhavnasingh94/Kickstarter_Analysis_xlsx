# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals as Louise's theatrical play Fever came close to its goal in a fairly short amount of time.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Every month had more successes than failures and cancellations for plays. The most successful outcome was seen on the months of May and June. The riskiest time of the year to launch the play is on the month of December as it was almost a 50/50 it would be a success or failue.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The trend we see here is the with the goals ranging from <1000-4999, and 35000-44999 has had higher percentage of success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge I encountered was making the pivot table look like the example shown on instruction with very little instruction given on how to get there. I was left to figure it out on my own.

## Results

- Two conclusions I can draw about the outcomes based on Launch Data is the plays don't do well during the holiday/Christmas season. Summer is when there are more shows, and more success rate. During November and December, there are fewer total shows all together and it is risky that the play may not be successful.

- Based on the trend of success and failure rate correlating with goals, it is safer to have a goal of either <1000-4999, and 35000-44999 to be successful. For more profit, I'd say 35000-44999 would be a good range to set a goal for.


- Some limitation of the data is that the data only shows for play only in the United States and Great Britain. We are unsure where Louise is planning on having her play taken place and we also don't know whether the plays that were successful or not, would yeild the same result in other countries as well.
